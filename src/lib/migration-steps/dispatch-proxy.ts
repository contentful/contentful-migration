/*
  Base class that dynamically dispatches property update messages based on the function being called
  For example, if the proxy is called with `proxy.name('foo')` it dispatches a message with `props: { name: 'foo' }`
  That means that any dispatch function is dynamically created at call time,
  making it unnecessary to implement every step of the DSL manually.
  If an existing method is found on the instance, that method is returned instead
